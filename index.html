          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a
          host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide
          programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p id="intro-text-2">
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements
          such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
          supplementing it with additional objects;<br />
          <strong>for example:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li id="intro-li-1">
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object
            Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to
            user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li id="intro-li-2">
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For
            example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information
            from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

        <header id="jsjava-title">JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p id="jsjava-text-1">
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language
          resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression
          syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
          JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p id="jsjava-text-2">
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based
          on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based
          object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
          inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
          special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
        </p>
        <p id="jsjava-text-3">
          JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and
          methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to
          implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

        <header id="var-title">Variables</header>
        <p id="var-text-1">
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform
          to certain rules.
        </p>
        <p id="var-text-2">
          A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be
          digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the
          characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
        </p>
        <p id="var-text-3">
          You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences
          as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
        <header id="decl-title">Declaring Variables</header>
        <p id="decl-text-1">You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
        <p id="decl-text-2">With the keyword var. <strong>For example:</strong></p>
        <code id="decl-code-1">var x = 42.</code>
        <p id="decl-text-3">This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
        <p id="decl-text-4">By simply assigning it a value. <strong>For example:</strong></p>
        <code id="decl-code-2">x = 42.</code>
        <p id="decl-text-5">
          This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
        </p>
        <p id="decl-text-6">With the keyword let. <strong>For example:</strong></p>
        <code id="decl-code-3">let y = 13.</code>
        <p id="decl-text-7">This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
        <header id="scope-title">Variable scope</header>
        <p id="scope-text-1">
          When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any
          other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable,
          because it is available only within that function.
        </p>
        <p id="scope-text-2">
          JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is
          local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5,
          because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
          is an if statement.
        </p>
        <p id="scope-code-1"><code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code></p>
        <p id="scope-text-3">
          This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in <strong>ECMAScript 2015.</strong>
        </p>
        <p id="scope-code-2"><code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined</code></p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
        <header id="global-title">Global variables</header>
        <p id="global-text-1">
          Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set
          and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
        </p>
        <p id="global-text-2">
          Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying
          the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this
          variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header id="const-title">Constants</header>
        <p id="const-text-1">
          You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as
          for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric,
          or underscore characters.
        </p>
        <p id="const-code-1"><code>const PI = 3.14;</code></p>
        <p id="const-text-2">
          A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be
          initialized to a value.
        </p>
        <p id="const-text-3">
          The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the
          identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
        </p>
        <p id="const-text-4">
          You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope.
          <strong>For example:</strong>
        </p>
        <p id="const-code-2">
          <code
            >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g =
            5; var g; //statements }</code
          >
        </p>
        <p id="const-text-5">
          However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.
        </p>
        <p id="const-code-3"><code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code></p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
        <header id="data-title">Data types</header>
        <p id="data-text-1">The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li id="data-li-1">Boolean. true and false.</li>
          <li id="data-li-2">
            null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
            NULL, or any other variant.
          </li>
          <li id="data-li-3">undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
          <li id="data-li-4">Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
          <li id="data-li-5">String. "Howdy"</li>
          <li id="data-li-6">Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
          <li id="data-li-7">and Object</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="data-text-2">
          Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your
          applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as
          named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.

      <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
        <header id="if-title">if...else statement</header>
        <p id="if-text-1">
          Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a
          statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
        </p>
        <p id="if-code-1"><code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code></p>
        <p id="if-text-2">
          condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to
          true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1
          and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
        </p>
        <p id="if-text-3">
          You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
        </p>
        <p id="if-code-2">
          <code
            >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else
            { statement_last; }</code
          >
        </p>
        <p id="if-text-4">
          In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute
          multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block
          statements, especially when nesting if statements:
        </p>
        <p id="if-code-3">
          <code
            >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true; statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
            statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false; statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
          >
        </p>
        <p id="if-text-5">
          It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with
          equality when glancing over the code. <strong>For example:</strong>
        </p>
        <p id="if-code-4"><code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code></p>
        <p id="if-text-6">
          If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around
          the assignment. <strong>For example:</strong>
        </p>
        <p id="if-code-5"><code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code></p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
        <header id="while-title">while statement</header>
        <p id="while-text-1">
          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as
          follows:
        </p>
        <p id="while-code-1"><code>while (condition) statement</code></p>
        <p id="while-text-2">
          If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following
          the loop.
        </p>
        <p id="while-text-3">
          The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed
          and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the
          statement following while.
        </p>
        <p id="while-text-4">To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.</p>
        <p id="while-strong-1"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p id="while-text-5">The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
        <p id="while-code-2"><code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code></p>
        <p id="while-text-6">
          With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li id="while-li-1">After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
          <li id="while-li-2">After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
          <li id="while-li-3">After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="while-text-7">
          After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.

          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword,
          followed by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li id="func-li-1">The name of the function.</li>

        </ul>
        <p id="func-text-2">For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
        <p id="func-code-1"><code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code></p>
        <p id="func-text-3">
          The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the
          argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by
          the function.
        </p>
        <p id="func-code-2"><code>return number * number;</code></p>
        <p id="func-text-4">
          Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if
          the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.
